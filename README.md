## Installation
This package has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 LTS with ROS Melodic/Noetic on [Intel Realsense D435i](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435i/) and NVIDIA Jetson [Xavier NX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-series/), [Orin NX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/) and [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html). Make sure you have installed the compatible ROS version. 
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/onboard_detector.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

## Run demo
### Run on dataset
Please download the rosbag file from this link:
```
rosbag play -l multiple-objects.bag
roslaunch onboard_detector run_detector.launch
```

### Run on your device
Please adjust the configuration file under ```cfg/detector_param.yaml``` of your camera device. Also, change the color image topic name in ```scripts/yolo_detector/yolo_detector.py```

From the parameter file, you can find that the algorithm expects the following data from the robot:

- Depth image: ```/camera/depth/image_rect_raw```

- Robot pose: ```/mavros/local_position/pose```

- Robot odom (optional): ```/mavros/local_position/odom```

- Color image (optional if YOLO is applied): ```/camera/color/image_rect_raw```

- Aligned depth image (optional): ```/camera/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw```

```
# Launch your device first. Make sure it has the above data.
roslaunch onboard_detector run_detector.launch
```

## Issue
for ```ImportError: No module named yaml``` on Ubuntu 20.04, please run: 
```
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
```
